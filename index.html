	    <p>The FPGA Ignite Summer School series is a forum for bringing together established and new researchers in the field of reconfigurable computing and FPGAs.<br>
	       The goal is to identify and form new trends, educate people and facilitating collaborations within the reconfigurable computing community.<br>
               FPGA Ignite 2023 will have a strong emphasis on open-source hardware and tools.<br>
               Topics include HLS tools, Logic Synthesis (including interesting specialties for research), FPGA Place&Route as well as FPGA chip design.<br>
               During a hackathon on the last day, attendees will design an FPGA with custom tiles that will be manufactured in Sky130 technology.<br>
               Attendees will receive a board with that chip some time after the event.

	    <h2>Instructions</h2> 
	    <p> The summer school labs have been embedded within virtual mahine images along with all the required software. Here, you can find the instructions on downloading and installing Virtual Machine software like VirtualBox and KVM/QEMU as well the corresponding VM-images.</p>

	    <h5>Quick notes on the installation of Virtual Machines (Virtual Box and KVM/QEMU)</h5>
	    <ol>
		    <li><h4> Virtual Machine Software (Host)</h4>

            The virtual machine (VM) image is available in VDI-format for VirtualBox and QCOW2-Format for KVM/QEMU.
            
            If you have already VirtualBox or KVM/QEMU installed, continue to (2).
            
            Decide which virtual machine software to install. If unsure, use VirtualBox (easier installation).
            
            Download VirtualBox for your system here:
	    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Download links for VirtualBox</a> (Install and follow the instructions in the link provided).</li>

		    <li><h4>Extract Virtual Machine</h4>
            
            The VM-image is available in two formats. You need only the one that fits to the virtual machine software that you installed.
            
	    The image itself is compressed using 7zip to save space; it needs to be extracted before starting. If you haven't 7zip installed, install it using the appropriate binary provided in the package (linux, macos, windows, 32- and 64-bit). You can download 7-zip from here: <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">Download links for 7-zip</a>
            
	    Then extract the image using 7zip. The extracted image needs at least 64GB free disk space.</li>
            
            
		    <li><h4> Start Virtual Machine</h4>
            
			    Using the virtual machine software you chose, create a new virtual machine wich has at least Two CPUs and 20GB of RAM (more is better), and open the corresponding image. Then, start the virtual machine and you should see the Debian-system booting to the graphical login screen.  Done!</li>
            </ol>

            <td>Anis Hamadouche</td>
            <td>Anis Hamadouche is a final-year PhD student from Heriot-Watt University. Mr. Hamadouche’s work consists of theoretically analyzing the performance of iterative optimization algorithms, such as proximal algorithms and alternating direction  method of multipliers (ADMM), when the internal operations of the algorithms are executed with errors. The types of errors considered stem from approximations at hardware and software levels, for example, quantization under different types of numerical representations, including fixed- and floating-point representations. Although this work is very theoretical, it has wide-ranging implications. In fact, in contrast with prior work, it considers realistic error models and implementation in platforms like FPGAs. Mr. Hamadouche’s PhD is associated with the UDRC Phase III programme (https://udrc.eng.ed.ac.uk/), sponsored by UKRI’s EPSRC and the MoD. And, in this context, he has explored applications in control and image processing.</td>
            <td>Design and Implementation of Approximate Operator Splitting Algorithms On FPGA</td>
            <td>Any algorithm requires a computational platform to run. Some platforms, however, have limited size, power, or energy, especially if they are battery-operated. Examples include cell phones, unmanned vehicles like flying drones, or tiny sensors. Yet, they need to process information to make inferences about a signal or to compute a trajectory, which is done by running algorithms that often require a considerable amount of computation. Our goal is to investigate ways to reduce the total amount of power/energy/size of an algorithm by considering the full computational stack: from the task itself, to its algorithmic implementation, basic linear algebra operations, software, and hardware. Indeed, in each of these layers, there exist techniques to reduce power/energy/size, for instance, by reducing voltage or frequency, selecting a lower precision for representing numbers, or using approximate algorithms in linear algebra operations. However, such techniques are almost always considered in isolation without taking into account the impact on the downstream task. In this WP, we took a holistic view on this set of approximations and developed strategies to select the most effective approximations without undermining the task at hand. We thus made several experimental and theoretical contributions to the field.</td>

His research interests lie in Computer architecture and Security, especially focusing on cloud infrastructures and the security of FPGA-accelerated cloud environments by evaluating and defending various types of side channels and covert channels, as well as how to enable secure multi-tenant Cloud FPGAs.</td>
            <td>Thermal Covert Channels on smartSSDs</td>
            <td>Continued expansion of cloud computing offerings now includes SmartSSDs. Because of the FPGA component of the SmartSSD, cloud users who access the SmartSSD can instantiate custom circuits within the FPGA. This includes possibly malicious circuits for measurement of power and temperature. Normally, cloud users have no remote access to power and temperature data, but with SmartSSDs they could abuse the FPGA component to learn this information. This work shows for the first time that heat generated by a cloud user accessing the SSD component of the SmartSSD and the resulting temperature increase, can be measured by a different cloud user accessing the FPGA component of the same SmartSSD by using the ring oscillator (RO) circuits to measure temperature. The thermal state remains elevated for a few minutes after the SSD is heated up and can be measured from the FPGA side by a subsequent user for up to a few minutes after the SSD heating is done. Based on this temporal thermal state of the SmartSSD, a novel thermal communication channel is demonstrated for the first time.</td>

	<h3>LegUp High-Level Synthesis and its Commercialization, <a href="#jason-id">Jason Anderson</a></h3>
        <p> High-level synthesis (HLS) raises the level of abstraction for hardware design by allowing a software program to be automatically synthesized into a hardware circuit.  HLS holds the promise to reduce both the costs and time required for hardware design, and eventually, to bring the speed and energy benefits of hardware to those having solely software skills.  In this talk, I will overview the open-source LegUp HLS project, beginning with its genesis at the University of Toronto, and highlighting LegUp's key features relative to competing commercial and academic offerings.  LegUp HLS became the basis of a startup company, spawned in 2015 and ultimately acquired by Microchip in 2020.  I will describe the commercialization process, touching on issues surrounding IP ownership, incorporation, raising funds, and more, and recount some of the highlights and pitfalls along the journey.</p>

His research interests include design methodologies, architecture, circuits and applications of reconfigurable hardware.  Prior to joining the university, he spent 10 years in the industry at Xilinx, Inc., in San Jose, CA and Toronto, where he worked on commercial CAD tools for Xilinx FPGAs, both as an individual contributor and later, as a manager.  He is an inventor on over 30 issued U.S. patents, has co-authored 4 book chapters, and over 100 papers in peer-reviewed journals and international symposia.  In 2015, he co-founded LegUp Computing Inc. with three former graduate students to commercialize his team’s research on high-level synthesis (HLS).  The LegUp startup company received investment funding from Intel Capital in 2018, and was acquired in October 2020 by Microchip Technology.  LegUp HLS technology has been commercialzed as SmartHLS and is available to target Microchip FPGAs.  He is an IEEE Fellow (class of 2023).</p>
