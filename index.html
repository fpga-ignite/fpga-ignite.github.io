    <!-- Instructions -->
    <section id="instructions-section" class="wave-animation">
	    <h2>Instructions</h2> 
	    <p> The virtual machine image contains all the required software for the summer school. Here, you can find the instructions on downloading and installing Virtual Machine software like VirtualBox and KVM/QEMU as well as the corresponding VM-images.</p>

	    <h5>Quick notes on the installation of Virtual Machines (Virtual Box and KVM/QEMU)</h5>
	    <ol>
		    <li><h4> Virtual Machine Software (Host)</h4>

            The virtual machine (VM) image is available in VDI-format for VirtualBox and QCOW2-Format for KVM/QEMU.
            
            If you have already VirtualBox or KVM/QEMU installed, continue to (2).
            
            Decide which virtual machine software to install. If unsure, use VirtualBox (easier installation).
            
            Download VirtualBox for your system here:
	    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Download links for VirtualBox</a> (Install and follow the instructions in the link provided).</li>

            
	    <h5>Link for the Virtual Machine Images:</h5>
            The VM-image is available in two formats. You need only the one that fits to the virtual machine software that you installed.
	    The Virtual Machine image is compressed in 7zip format and available as a Virtual Box Image (VDI) and KVM (QCOW), get it here:
            
	    <br>Compressed KVM VM-image:</h6> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/w1grfcv5zhyitpwg1jcuw/summer_school_2024.qcow2-Hiko.7z?rlkey=eikp90srp7mzcotrgzlcpclyl&dl=0" target="_blank">KVM link</a>
	    <br>Compressed VDI VM-image:</h6> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/b5xlqjrock0hmgvulak3i/summer_school_2024.vdi-Hiko.7z?rlkey=7jyd377ioueiwaavf63n0ini1&dl=0" target="_blank">VDI link</a>

		    <li><h4>Extract Virtual Machine</h4>
	    The VM needs to be extracted before starting. If you haven't 7zip installed, install it using the appropriate binary provided in the package (linux, macos, windows, 32- and 64-bit). You can download 7-zip from here: <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">Download links for 7-zip</a>
            
	    Then extract the image using 7zip. </li>
            
            
		    <li><h4> Start Virtual Machine</h4>
            
			    Using the virtual machine software you chose, create a new virtual machine wich has at least Two CPUs and 20GB of RAM (more is better), and open the corresponding image. Then, start the virtual machine and you should see the Debian-system booting to the graphical login screen.  Done!<br>To log into the VM use:
			    <br><b>Username:</b> user
			    <br><b>Password/root password:</b> FPGAIgnite </li>
            </ol>

The first level in this representation refines designs into a flattened graph of state elements (a generalization of registers) and the pure combinational transform arcs between them. This poster will discuss (a purely hypothetical idea for) how this structure could be used to accelerate simulation on processors with reconfigurable instruction extensions by outsourcing the most expensive transform arcs to dedicated instructions. </td>

Using the open-source synthesis tool Yosys, we translate the circuit into a generic JSON netlist, insert the clock gates, and convert back to Verilog.</td>

            <td>Transpose convolution has shown prominence in many deep-learning applications. However, transpose convolution layers are computationally intensive due to the increased feature map size, which is due to adding zeros after each element in each row and column. Thus, convolution operation on the expanded input feature map leads to poor utilization of hardware resources. The main reason for unnecessary multiplication operations is zeros at predefined positions in the input feature map. Thus, we propose a kernel-segregated transpose convolution mechanism to overcome this problem. The implementation of the proposed method shows substantial savings in area and power consumption with reduced delay in the computation process. In the future, we will implement the transpose convolution layer using Xilinx Artix-7 and Intel Agilex-7 FPGA boards. </td>

		   <h7> Free and Open Source Silicon is here to stay!</h7>
		   <p> Long gone are the days where open source software was a niche. Today, even most risk-averse companies use open source software. A little bit unnoticed by some, the same success story is repeating itself for chip design right now. In this talk, Philipp will introduce the ideas around free and open source silicon, where we are today, and what a future might look like. You’ll also learn some best practices on how to make the most out of free and open source silicon.</p>

                   <h3>Guy Lemieux</h3>
		   <p>Guy is a Professor in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia where he teaches advanced digital design and computer systems/architecture related courses. His research focuses on improving FPGA devices and CAD tools, in particular making them easier to use and more efficient for computing tasks. His research has shown how to design FPGA interconnect to be more efficient, that CAD tool performance can be enhanced through parallelism, and that overlays are a much easier way to program FPGAs . His latest research is attempting to make machine learning and artificial intelligence applications more efficient on FPGAs through low-precision arithmetic, such as TinBiNN for binary neural networks, and using custom accelerator interfaces.</p>

		   <p>Prof. Lemieux graduated from University of Toronto where he was part of a team that designed NUMAchine, a cache-coherent multiprocessor built from scratch using MIPS R4400 CPUs, custom PCBs and FPGAs. Throughout his career, he's designed or co-designed various soft processors and accelerators (MIPS and NIOS clones, VIPERS, VEGAS, VENICE, ORCA RISC-V, and Saturn-V) and co-founded VectorBlox Computing which developed the MXP (Matrix Processor), a tensor accelerator. Within RISC-V International, he is an elected member of the Technical Steering Committee and chair of the SoftCPU Special Interest Group . Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, he worked with a small team from the SIG to develop new technology for managing custom instructions without namespace collisions in the ISA, resulting in Google's CFU-Playground as well as CFU interfaces in Lattice's RISC-V RX IP core and Efinix's Titanium FPGAs. After extending this further to provide virtualization and protection (like virtual memory), it is being offered as a basis specification for the new Composable Extensions (CX) Task Group which he helped launch. He was also a member of the RISC-V Vector and the early Cache Management Operations committees. Finally, he serves as a Voting Member and Editor within the Working Group for IEEE P3109 Standard for Arithmetic Formats for Machine Learning which has been releasing updates through its Interim Report.</p>
