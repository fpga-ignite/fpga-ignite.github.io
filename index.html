		   <p> Long gone are the days where open source software was a niche. Today, even most risk-averse companies use open source software. A little bit unnoticed by some, the same success story is repeating itself for chip design right now. In this talk, Philipp will introduce the ideas around free and open source silicon, where we are today, and what a future might look like. You’ll also learn some best practices on how to make the most out of free and open source silicon.</p>

                   <h3>Guy Lemieux</h3>
		   <p>Guy is a Professor in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia where he teaches advanced digital design and computer systems/architecture related courses. His research focuses on improving FPGA devices and CAD tools, in particular making them easier to use and more efficient for computing tasks. His research has shown how to design FPGA interconnect to be more efficient, that CAD tool performance can be enhanced through parallelism, and that overlays are a much easier way to program FPGAs . His latest research is attempting to make machine learning and artificial intelligence applications more efficient on FPGAs through low-precision arithmetic, such as TinBiNN for binary neural networks, and using custom accelerator interfaces.</p>

		   <p>Prof. Lemieux graduated from University of Toronto where he was part of a team that designed NUMAchine, a cache-coherent multiprocessor built from scratch using MIPS R4400 CPUs, custom PCBs and FPGAs. Throughout his career, he's designed or co-designed various soft processors and accelerators (MIPS and NIOS clones, VIPERS, VEGAS, VENICE, ORCA RISC-V, and Saturn-V) and co-founded VectorBlox Computing which developed the MXP (Matrix Processor), a tensor accelerator. Within RISC-V International, he is an elected member of the Technical Steering Committee and chair of the SoftCPU Special Interest Group . Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, he worked with a small team from the SIG to develop new technology for managing custom instructions without namespace collisions in the ISA, resulting in Google's CFU-Playground as well as CFU interfaces in Lattice's RISC-V RX IP core and Efinix's Titanium FPGAs. After extending this further to provide virtualization and protection (like virtual memory), it is being offered as a basis specification for the new Composable Extensions (CX) Task Group which he helped launch. He was also a member of the RISC-V Vector and the early Cache Management Operations committees. Finally, he serves as a Voting Member and Editor within the Working Group for IEEE P3109 Standard for Arithmetic Formats for Machine Learning which has been releasing updates through its Interim Report.</p>

                   <h3>Dirk Koch</h3>
		   <p> Dirk Koch is an expert in FPGA technology. His group maintains the FABulous open-source eFPGA framework and various other FPGA-related projects.</p>
		   <p>His class will briefly introduce the basic concepts of eFPGAs and the FABulous framework.
We will then investigate the methods of using ISA subsetting, hardened custom instructions, reconfigurable custom instructions and software emulated instructions. We will also learn in particular how reconfigurable custom instructions can be made available in a CPU core. With this knowledge, we will run a lab where we will define a custom eFPGA eFPGA and implement custom instructions on that fabric using the open-source tools Yosys and nextpnr.</p>
