                   <h3>Guy Lemieux</h3>
		   <p>Guy is a Professor in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia where he teaches advanced digital design and computer systems/architecture related courses. His research focuses on improving FPGA devices and CAD tools, in particular making them easier to use and more efficient for computing tasks. His research has shown how to design FPGA interconnect to be more efficient, that CAD tool performance can be enhanced through parallelism, and that overlays are a much easier way to program FPGAs . His latest research is attempting to make machine learning and artificial intelligence applications more efficient on FPGAs through low-precision arithmetic, such as TinBiNN for binary neural networks, and using custom accelerator interfaces.</p>

		   <p>Prof. Lemieux graduated from University of Toronto where he was part of a team that designed NUMAchine, a cache-coherent multiprocessor built from scratch using MIPS R4400 CPUs, custom PCBs and FPGAs. Throughout his career, he's designed or co-designed various soft processors and accelerators (MIPS and NIOS clones, VIPERS, VEGAS, VENICE, ORCA RISC-V, and Saturn-V) and co-founded VectorBlox Computing which developed the MXP (Matrix Processor), a tensor accelerator. Within RISC-V International, he is an elected member of the Technical Steering Committee and chair of the SoftCPU Special Interest Group . Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, he worked with a small team from the SIG to develop new technology for managing custom instructions without namespace collisions in the ISA, resulting in Google's CFU-Playground as well as CFU interfaces in Lattice's RISC-V RX IP core and Efinix's Titanium FPGAs. After extending this further to provide virtualization and protection (like virtual memory), it is being offered as a basis specification for the new Composable Extensions (CX) Task Group which he helped launch. He was also a member of the RISC-V Vector and the early Cache Management Operations committees. Finally, he serves as a Voting Member and Editor within the Working Group for IEEE P3109 Standard for Arithmetic Formats for Machine Learning which has been releasing updates through its Interim Report.</p>

		   <p>Riadh is an Ex-Synopsys FPGA engineer on their flagship FPGA emulation system ZEBU. In 2017, he was a Japanese Government Scholarship (MEXT) recipient where he obtained his Master and PhD of Engineering in Computer Science from the University of Tsukuba in March 2020 and 2023 respectively. His research revolves around many-core processor architectures and overlays, High-Performance Computing and reconfigurable accelerators. He is also enthusiast about making his own many-core processor chip start-up. Riadh is currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Novel Computing Technologies Group at Heidelberg University, Germany, where he designed the SPARKLE architecture that was implemented on a VU9P FPGA with 1,024 RISC-V Barrel Processor cores and 16,384 interleaved Hardware Threads, delivering 400 GIPS on a single FPGA device.</p>
